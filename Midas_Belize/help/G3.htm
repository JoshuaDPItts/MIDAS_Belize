<div class="purple"><h2>G3. Management Operations</h2></div>

<p>This variable includes:</p>

<p><i>a) Existence of a management plan</i><br>
The Management Plan sets out the strategic directions for the MMA management program. It states the overall goals and objectives to be achieved in the MMA, the institutional structure of the management system, and a portfolio of management measures and whether the plan is enforceable. The effective management of the MMA is based on the achievement of goals and objectives through the use of appropriate management measures. The existence and adoption of a management plan means that there are strategic directions and actions for the implementation of the MMA.</p> 

<p><i>b) Clearly defined enforcement procedures</i><br>
Enforcement is a crucial step in the MMA management system. Clearly defined enforcement procedures allow both MMA enforcement staff to more effectively undertake their duties and MMA resource users to be aware of consequences of non-compliance. Having clear systems for enforcement and engaging the community in enforcement and monitoring may help the MMA to achieve its objectives with minimal levels of conflict and costs. However, to properly carry out enforcement activities (surveillance, constructing guardhouses, installing marker buoys, etc.) has a financial cost. For this reason, the MMA management needs to have adequate financial resources available to ensure project's success.</p>

<p><i>c) Conflict management</i><br>
If resource users are to follow the rules, a mechanism for discussing and resolving conflicts and infractions is necessary. The term 'conflict' can be taken to mean just about any situation in which there is a clash of interests or ideas. In the context of an MMA, it usually means that there is a group or groups whose interests are in opposition to those of the MMA. Conflicts involving MMA are inevitable as, for example, an area is taken out of production, new rights and rules for use of marine resources are implemented, and individual and group interests in the marine resources are affected. The MMA staff face the challenge of trying to respond to these conflicts so that unproductive consequences can be avoided while human well-being and the natural environment are protected. This variable defines the level of compliance by the community or people to the rules enforced by federal government or agencies. Rules and regulations define specifically what acts are required, permitted and forbidden by stakeholders and government agencies within the protected area. Lack of compliance to these rules is not only detrimental to the resources, but to gaining stakeholder support. It is widely perceived that if users are not complying with the regulations, it will be difficult to gain anyone's trust, support or participation. However, stakeholders may violate rules and regulations if these are not well understood or if they don't make sense to stakeholders. Therefore, to ensure a greater success of the MMA, stakeholders need to learn its rules, regulations and enforcement arrangements through training or educations programs.</p>

<ul>

<li><b>Very Low:</b> There is very little management operation.</li>

<li><b>Moderate:</b> Moderate level of operation creates some positive impact on the MMA management and effectiveness. </li>
<li><b>High:</b> High level of operation ensures effective stakeholder participation and representation.  </li>
<li><b>Very High:</b> Very high levels of operation make marine management highly effective thus increasing the pace for marine conservation and the room for implementation of newer policies.</li>
