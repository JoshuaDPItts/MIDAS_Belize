<div class="purple"><h2>G1. Stakeholder Involvement</h2></div>

<p>The level of stakeholder participation in the management of the MMA is a measure of the amount of active involvement of people in making MMA management decisions or participating in management activities. Stakeholders are individuals, groups, or organizations who are interested, involved or affected (positively or negatively) by the MMA. Their actions can support or sustain an MMA, being potential partners or threats in managing the marine reserve. Therefore, the active participation of coastal resource stakeholders in the planning and management of an MMA can improve its success.  </p>
