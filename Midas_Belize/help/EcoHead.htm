<p>Regardless of their many social benefits and aims, MMAs are ultimately a tool for conserving the biophysical conditions of our oceans and coats. In most cases, the link between the biological state of the marine environment and the livelihoods, income and food security of the people who use and depend upon the resource is explicit and intimate. Therefore, beyond characterizing natural systems, the measurement of ecological indicators can also be useful when viewed in the context of socio-economic and governance conditions that operate in and around the MMA.</p>
