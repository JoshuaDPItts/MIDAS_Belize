<div class="purple"><h2>Governance Index</h2></div>

<p>The Governance Index is used to evaluate the state of governance and is visualized as a graph with two columns. The x-axis of the graph shows time, with the column on the left representing the present state of governance and the column on the right representing the expected governance conditions in the near future. The y-axis displays five linguistic scale values for the state of governance, and both columns have corresponding vertical coloration that goes from green (Excellent) to Red (Very Bad). </p>

<p>There are points within each column that represent the state of governance based on user input and expert evaluation (present state) or user prediction and expert best and worst-case prediction (near future state). The expert evalutation and expert best and worst-case predictions are fixed values based on expert opinion, survey data, and literature review. These points are meant to provide a baseline assessment of the state of governance to which users can compare their outcomes. User evaluation and user prediction points are calculated by a simple multi-attribute model that uses a specific set of CDFs and weights. As the user changes the values of these CDFs, the Governance Index outcome instantly adjusts to reflect the new values. This allows users to conduct thought experiments, evaulating how the state of governance is affected by altering the level of one or more CDFs. </p>

<p>The following CDFs are used to calculate the user evaulation of the present state of governance:<br>
G1. Stakeholder involvement<br>
G2. Stakeholder compliance with rules and regulations<br>
G3. Management operations<br>
G4. Support from government agencies<br>
G5. Empowerment<br>
S3. Non-extractive alternative livelihoods<br>
S4. Socio-Economic benefits from establishment of MMA<br>
E5. Focal species abundance<br>
G6. Governance outlook over next five years, is used in the equations to calculate the user prediction of the state of governance in the near future.</p>
