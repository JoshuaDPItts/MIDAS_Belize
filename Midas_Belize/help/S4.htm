<div class="pink"><h2>S4. Socio-Economic Benefits from Establishment of MMA</h2></div>

<p>Socioeconomic benefits from establishment of MMAs include food security and income generating activities. This results in general nutrition and health, quality of life and relative wealth for people in the community. This is an important indicator that helps to check if the MMA is providing improvements. The incentive structure facing individuals in a community will directly impact their support for an MMA. Community members are more likely to feel positively about an MMA and therefore support it voluntarily if the costs of participating and/or complying with the regulations (i.e. traveling further to get to new fishing grounds, restricting lucrative but destructive activities) do not exceed the benefits (such as any personal enjoyment from conservation, or the positive MMA outcomes identified above). </p>

<div class="pink"><h3>Levels of Socio-Economic Benefits:</h3></div>

<ul>

<li><b>Very Low:</b> Very poor conditions reflect comparative lack of wealth and poor quality of life in the community.</li>
<li><b>Low:</b> Low socioeconomic benefits from the establishment of the MMA.</li>
<li><b>Moderate:</b> Medium level indicates a minimum access and distribution of basic resources.</li>
<li><b>High:</b> High Socio-economic benefits resulting from the establishment of the protected area.</li>
<li><b>Very High:</b> Very high level leads to better quality of life as well as human development.</li>
</ul>
