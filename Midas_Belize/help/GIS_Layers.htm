<h1>GIS Panel: Layers</h1>

<p>In designing MIDAS, we integrated two approaches, spatial decision support system (SDSS), and Ecosystem-Based Management (EBM). A SDSS includes an easy-to-use interface that allows users to explore possible options, as well as analytical functions that generate feasible solutions based on user-specified criteria and preferences. Users can change their criteria and preferences and repeat the analysis process many times with SDSS. The MIDAS user has the ability to vary the inputs to get a variety of contexts of risks. </p>

<p>Layers are selected by checking the corresponding box, labeled "Turn layer on". The satellite image view can be turned on or off by pressing the appropriate button below. This enables user to access important GIS layers for this MMA (see Figure 16 in full User Guide). </p>
