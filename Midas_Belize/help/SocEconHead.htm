<div class="pink"><h2>Socioeconomic Critical Determining Factors (CDFs)</h2></div>

<p>The goals and objectives of many MMAs include socio-economic considerations such as food security, livelihood opportunities, monetary and non-monetary benefits, equitable distribution of benefits, compatibility with local culture, and environmental awareness and knowledge. Understanding the socio-economic context of stakeholders involved with/or influenced by the MMA (individuals, households, groups, communities, organizations) is essential for assessing, predicting and managing marine resources.</p>

<p>The use of socio-economic indicators allows MMA managers to a) incorporate and monitor stakeholder group concerns and interests into the management process; b) determine the impacts of management decisions on the stakeholders; and c) demonstrate the value of the MMA to the public and decision-makers.</p>
