<div class="purple"><h2>G5. Empowerment</h2></div>

<p>This variable includes:</p>

<p><i>a) Level of education of the community</i><br>
This refers to the overall educational and skill levels of the communities. A community with a generally high education level will be more willing to participate in conservation efforts.</p> 

<p><i>b) Level of information about the environment</i><br>
In order for people to take action to protect and manage the environment, they need to understand how the natural ecosystem works. Those with higher levels of knowledge of natural history tend to be more receptive to management initiatives, such as MMAs, and provide more support to its management operations. This knowledge can come either from scientific research or from stakeholder observations, experiences, beliefs and perceptions of cause and effect.  </p>

<p><i>c) Capacity-building training</i><br>
To participate effectively in MMA management, stakeholders need to be empowered to have greater awareness about why a MMA is needed and what are its functions. Stakeholders need to be equipped with knowledge, skills and attitudes to prepare them to carry out new tasks and meet future challenges. Capacity building must address not only technical and managerial dimensions but also attitudes and behavioral patterns. Capacity-building may be carried out by the MMA staff or by another organization, such as a non-governmental organization (NGO) </p>

<div class="purple"><h3>Levels of Empowerment:</h3></div>

<ul>

<li><b>Very Low:</b> Low empowerment leads to lack of community participation and, ultimately, the failure of a MMA.</li>
<li><b>Low:</b> Low empowerment of local community groups results in lack of support of the MMA.  </li>
<li><b>Moderate:</b> Moderate level of empowerment is still not that effective but better than none at all. </li>
<li><b>High:</b> High-level community empowerment affects compliance and community involvement.  </li>
<li><b>Very High:</b> Very high empowerment is desirable since it ensures the continued success of a MMA.</li>
</ul>
