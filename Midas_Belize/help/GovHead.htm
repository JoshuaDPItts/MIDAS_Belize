<p>Governance is the complex of ways by which individuals and institutions, both public and private, manage their common concerns. In the context of MMAs, governance refers to the structures and processes used to govern behavior, both public and private, in the coastal area and the resources and activities it contains. In a MMA, there is a need to create a governance system capable of managing multiple uses in an integrated way through the cooperation and coordination of government agencies at different levels of authority and of different economic sectors.</p>
