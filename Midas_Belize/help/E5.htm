<div class="blue"><h2>E5. Focal Species Abundance</h2></div>

<p>Species abundance is the number of individuals of a particular species found to occur within or outside the MMA. It is a commonly used proxy for population size and it is thought to reflect the status of a species' population within a specific location. Species abundance is one of the most widely used biological 'success' measures of management effectiveness.
A focal species is an organism of ecological and/or human value whose management through the MMA is of priority interest. Examples of focal species are conch, lobster, shark, and commercial fish species such as snappers and groupers. The protection, enhancement and/or maintenance of populations of focal species are among the most common reasons for using MMAs. Improved and sustained numbers of focal species in the MMA through time is widely seen to indicate effective MMA use. </p>

<div class="blue"><h3>Levels of Focal Species Abundance:</h3></div>

<ul>

<li><b>Very Low:</b> Focal species rarely seen if ever. No viable population exists. It will have major impacts in ecosystem health and/or fisheries.</li>
<li><b>Low:</b> Focal species rare, few mature adults in population, populations rely on emigration from elsewhere for persistence and not capable of supporting fishery.</li>
<li><b>Moderate:</b> Focal species present, but at low abundance and/or small sizes; population sustainable.</li>
<li><b>High:</b> Focal species at medium abundance/biomass.</li>
<li><b>Very High:</b> High abundance/density of focal species, large individuals, high biomass.</li>
</ul>
