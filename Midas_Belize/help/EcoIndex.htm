<div class="blue"><h2>Ecological Index</h2></div>

<p>The Ecological Index is used to evaluate overall ecosystem health int he areas in and around the MMA. The index is visualized as a graph with two columns. The x-axis of the graph shows time, with the column on the left representing present ecosystem health and the column on the right representing the expected level of ecosystem health in the near future. The y-axis displays five linguistic scale values for ecosystem health, and both columns have corresponding vertical coloration that goes from green (Excellent) to Red (Very Bad). </p>

<p>There are points within each column that represent ecosystem health based on user input and expert evaluation (present state) or user prediction and expert best and worst-case prediction (near future state). The expert evalutation and expert best and worst-case predictions are fixed values based on expert opinion, survey data, and literature review. These points are meant to provide a baseline assessment of ecosystem health to which users can compare their outcomes. User evaluation and user prediction points are calculated by a simple multi-attribute model that uses a specific set of CDFs and weights. As the user changes the values of these CDFs, the Ecological Index outcome instantly adjusts to reflect the new values. This allows users to conduct thought experiments, evaulating how ecosystem health is affected by altering the level of one or more CDFs. </p>

<p>The following CDFs are used to calculate the user evaulation of present ecosystem system:<br>
E1. Level of fishing effort<br>
E2. Relative change in habitat extent<br>
E3. Habitat quality<br>
E4. Herbivory<br>
E5. Focal species abundance<br>
G2. Stakeholder compliance with rules and regulations<br>
G4. Support from government agencies<br>
G5. Empowerment<br>
</p>

<p>E6. Expected change in ecosystem health over five years, is included in the equations to calculate the user prediction of ecosystem health in the near future.</p>
