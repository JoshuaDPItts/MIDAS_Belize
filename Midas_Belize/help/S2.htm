<div class="pink"><h2>S2. Perception of Local Extractive Resources</h2></div>

<p>This variable is a measure of what the users of extractive marine resources think about the availability of target fish species, seashells, mangrove trees, wood, and other extractive resources, and their perceptions on changes in availability of these target species. This indicator is useful for determining if the MMA management is achieving its objective of increasing harvests of seafood and other extractive resources, and consequently increasing the availability of local caught species. If the perceptions are a positive increase, then the users may be more receptive to MMA management. If the perceptions are negative, then the users may be less receptive to MMA management, and changes in management operations may be necessary. The indicator is also a useful measure of resource abundance, availability and size, and species composition. </p>

<li><b>Moderate:</b> Current use poses moderate level of threat.</li>
<li><b>High:</b> High level of threat is perceived given the aggressive marine resource pattern.</li>
