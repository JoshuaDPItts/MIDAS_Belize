<h1>GIS Panel: Risk Model</h1>

<p>The declining health of marine ecosystems around the world is of great concern. There is a need for ecosystem-based marine spatial planning in order to maintain healthy coastal and ocean ecosystems and sustain human uses of the ocean. Informing stakeholders and managers of MMAs about the spatial distribution of health and risk is critical to overall MMA effectiveness. One proposed solution to this problem is to highlight perceptions concerning the health and threat to coral, mangrove, seagrass, and algae in spatial decision making using a simple additive model through map overlay. All threats in each cell are added to compute overall risk in each cell of the MMA.</p>
