<div class="pink"><h2>S5. Perception of Seafood Availability</h2></div>

<p>Perception of seafood availability is a measure of what the primary food purchaser/preparer in the household thinks about the local availability of seafood for his/her own consumption.
This indicator is important for understanding the contribution of the MMA to food security in the local community. FAO defines household food security as "that state of affairs where all people at all times have physical and economic access to adequate, safe and nutritious food for all household members, without undue risk of losing such access". </p>
