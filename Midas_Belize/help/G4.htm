<div class="purple"><h2>G4. Support from Government Agencies</h2></div>

<p>This variable includes:</p>

<p><i>a) Existence and adequacy of enabling legislation</i><br>
It is a measure of formal legislation in place to provide the MMA with a sound legal foundation so that its goals and objectives can be recognized, explained, respected, accomplished and enforced. The establishment of a MMA more often than not requires the drafting and adoption of appropriate supportive legislation and in some cases the recognition of traditional laws. This variable ensures that the management plan is supported by adequate legislation in order for its successful implementation.</p> 

<p><i>b) Long-term support of local government</i><br>
Supportive local leadership is a contributing factor to the success of marine management projects. </p>
