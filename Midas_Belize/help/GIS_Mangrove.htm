<h1>GIS Panel: Mangrove Assessment Model</h1>

<p>
Unlike many countries in the tropics, Belize has retained large areas of mangrove forest 386 km coastline fringed by an almost continuous mangrove belt. Large-scale preservation was possible largely due to historically low population and development pressure. However, rapid coastal development and associated deforestation has increased threat to intact mangrove stands in recent years.
</p>

<p>
The Forest (Protection of Mangroves) Regulations of Belize (1989, revised 2003) states it is "desirable in the national interest to establish rules and regulations to protect mangrove communities. No person shall alter, allow, or cause to be altered any mangrove [black mangrove (Avicennia germinans), red mangrove (Rhizophora mangle) and white mangrove (Laguncularia racernosa)] in jurisdictional water without first obtaining a permit from the Department [of Forestry]" on any "privately owned and public lands". Several ecosystem functions are included as factors considered when determining if a project is "in the public interest despite environmental damage". In order to minimize ecosystem service losses, permits should be issued such that mangrove stands with the least ecosystem service value are preferentially selected for deforestation over stands with greater value.
</p>

<p>
Detailed economic valuation of individual mangrove stands would be data-intensive and very costly and hence the MIDAS Mangrove Assessment Model estimates the relative likelihood of mangrove stands contributing to several key ecosystem services where relative models were assigned based on spatial relationships using empirical literature. Hence MIDAS uses relative values assigned based on existing valuation data or simple spatial relationships itemized below.
</p>

<p>
1) Tourism value
<ul>
<li>Increases if adjacent to a protected area or park (mainland)</li>
<li>Increases if backed by rainforest (mainland)</li>
<li>Increases if within 5km of development on the barrier (islands)</li>
<li>Increases if land is above water (islands)</li>
</ul>
2) Storm buffering
<ul>
<li>Based on valuation data presented in WRI's Costal Capital Belize working paper (Cooper 2009, data provided by Lauretta Burke at WRI)</li>
</ul>
3) Fishery
<ul>
<li>Increases if adjacent to seagrass beds (differentiated by type)</li>
<li>Increases if within 500m of a reef</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
The MIDAS mangrove model option allows the display of risk associated with loss of ecosystem services resulting from cutting mangrove stands. The user can choose an area of mangrove to cut by displaying mangrove layer on the map (green) and using the computer mouse to start at an initial point on this mangrove and outline an area by dragging across. This cutting zone, consisting of 500m mangrove forest grid cells, is displayed in pink on the map, and while impact on tourism, nursery, protection and total score is displayed in the panel on the left. If a single cell is selected, the values for that cell will be displayed; when multiple cells are selected, ecosystem service values are averaged over all selected cells.
