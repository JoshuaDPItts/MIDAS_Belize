<div class="blue"><h2>E4. Herbivory</h2></div>

<p>Herbivory measures the level and abundance of both invertebrate herbivores (including urchins, crabs, limpets) and vertebrate herbivores (including reef fishes, sea turtles, dugongs). Herbivore species (animals that only consume plant matter) are extremely important to the health of coral reefs. They maintain the balance between corals and macroalgae, which potentially out compete the corals. Thus, they increase coral coverage on reefs, promote resilience to disturbances, and increase benthic diversity. </p>

<div class="blue"><h3>Levels of Herbivory:</h3></div>

<ul>

<li><b>Very Low:</b> Large herbivores and urchins absent, no evidence of herbivory keeping algae in check.</li>
<li><b>Low:</b> Large herbivores and urchins rare, microherbivores present.</li>
<li><b>Moderate:</b>Moderate herbivory, missing one or two key species.</li>
<li><b>High:</b> Large herbivores present, but in low abundance.</li>
<li><b>Very High:</b> Very high abundance of large herbivores, like large parrotfish and sea turtles. Sea urchins also abundant.</li>
</ul>
