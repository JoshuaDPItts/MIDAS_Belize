<div class="blue"><h2>E2. Relative Change in Habitat Extent</h2></div>

<p>This variable refers to relative changes (both positive and negative) in key marine and terrestrial habitats inside and outside the MMA after it is established. Habitat is defined as the living space of an organism, population or community, and it is characterized by both its biotic and physical properties. Habitat types are distinguished from each other by both biotic and abiotic composition and structure. Total area (in km^2), configuration and physical location are important in describing extent. Disturbance events in the community, whether anthropogenic or natural, can lead to changes in habitat extent, structures and habitat complexity. MMAs are used to prevent or reduce the frequency and intensity of man-made disturbances in an area so as to prevent major changes in the habitat within. </p>

<div class="blue"><h3>Levels of Relative Change in Habitat Extent:</h3></div>

<ul>

<li><b>Significant Decrease:</b> Great reduction of habitat extent of key marine and terrestrial habitats.</li>
<li><b>Moderate Decrease:</b> Moderate decrease: Reduction in key marine and terrestrial habitats is moderate.</li>
<li><b>No change:</b> No observable change in habitats. </li>
<li><b>Moderate Increase:</b> Increase in key marine and terrestrial habitats is moderate.</li>
<li><b>Significant increase:</b> Great increase in habitat extent of key marine and terrestrial habitats.</li>
</ul>
