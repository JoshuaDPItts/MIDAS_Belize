<div class="blue"><h2>E3. Habitat Quality</h2></div>

<p>Communities of organisms are dependent on the presence of adequate living space within which to exist and reproduce. Disturbance events in the community, whether natural or man-made, can lead to changes in habitat structure and declines in complexity. Such changes may in turn cause reductions in target species abundance and changes in population structure and community composition.  It is not surprising that the maintenance of ecosystem 'health' is considered a critical measure of success in many MMAs, particularly in large-scale, ecosystem-level MMAs that are representative of multiple habitats.<p/>

<p>This variable includes:</p>

<p><i>a) Coverage (distribution)</i><br>
The habitat distribution within a specified area or ecosystem is the structural and spatial characterization of all habitat types represented, based on their (1) Physical location; (2) configuration (e.g. placement next to one another); and (3) extent in terms of total area (km^2).</p> 

<p><i>b) Rugosity</i><br>
Rugosity is a measure of the habitat's structural complexity. The habitat complexity is defined by the extent (area in km^2) and diversity (number) of habitat types and distinct zones found within a specified area. 
Higher habitat complexity does not necessarily indicate a better or healthier ecosystem; the 'right' level of complexity depends on what would occur naturally in the absence of human impacts.</p>

<p><i>c) Habitat Maturity/Integrity</i><br>
Habitat integrity can be defined as the likelihood that the distribution and complexity of living space in an area will persist through time. A 'healthy' habitat is therefore one that is considered to have strong integrity and is resilient to pronounced change. </p>

<p><i>c) Aesthetics</i><br>
Environmental aesthetics can be defined broadly as the interaction between an individual and the environment, in relation to beauty. Non-aesthetic values such as ecological or economic values are usually considered most important. However, the aesthetic experience is significant to the value we place on the natural environments, and preserving the aesthetic characteristics of an ecosystem improves its overall value. </p>

<div class="blue"><h3>Levels of Habitat Quality:</h3></div>

<ul>

<li><b>Pristine:</b> Intact system with near reef habitats such as mangroves and sea grass.</li>
<li><b>Good:</b> Reef, mangrove and seagrass systems with little natural or anthropogenic disturbances.  </li>
<li><b>Moderate:</b> Reef and other habitats present, but their function has been compromised (e.g. loss of living coral on reef, poor water quality, heavily silted seagrass, fragmented mangrove creek systems, etc.). </li>
<li><b>Poor:</b> Habitats limited in species diversity and/or abundance, extensive areas of disturbances (e.g. coral disease/death from bleaching, algal overgrowth on reefs and seagrass, sedimentation, etc.).  </li>
<li><b>Unrecognizable:</b> Worst condition signaling major impacts.</li>
</ul>
