<div class="purple"><h2>G2. Stakeholder Compliance with Rules and Regulations</h2></div>

<p>This variable defines the level of compliance by the community or people to the rules enforced by federal government or agencies. Rules and regulations define specifically what acts are required, permitted and forbidden by stakeholders and government agencies within the protected area. Lack of compliance to these rules is not only detrimental to the resources, but to gaining stakeholder support. It is widely perceived that if users are not complying with the regulations, it will be difficult to gain anyone's trust, support or participation. However, stakeholders may violate rules and regulations if these are not well understood or if they don't make sense to stakeholders. Therefore, to ensure a greater success of the MMA, stakeholders need to learn its rules, regulations and enforcement arrangements through training or educations programs.</p>

<li><b>Moderate:</b> Moderate level of compliance creates some positive impact on the MMA management.</li>
<li><b>High:</b> High compliance results in positive relationship between the government and the community. </li>
<li><b>Very High:</b> Very high levels of compliance make marine management highly effective thus increasing the pace for marine conservation and the room for implementation of newer policies.</li>
