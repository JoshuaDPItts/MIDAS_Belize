<div class="pink"><h2>S1. Perceived Threat Due to Development</h2></div>

<p>This variable defines the level of development including urban expansion, pollution, hotels, cruise ships, and other tourism activities near the MMA. Other major concerns include coral damage due to boat anchors, physical contact by divers with the corals and waste generated via development.  Various land use activities can affect the success of a MMA. For example, coastal construction can negatively impact the environment, or sedimentation both from logging and urban development can smother coral. In addition, industrial and domestic wastes are frequently discharged directly into waterways, generating an additional threat. The number (and density) of people living near the MMA have been proven to affect both environmental and social/governance conditions of the protected area. Social-science based studies show that population density is negatively correlated with the success of a MMA. </p>

<div class="pink"><h3>Levels of Perceived Threat Due to Development:</h3></div>

<ul>

<li><b>Very Low:</b> A very low level of development has a positive impact on the MMA since it has led to increased job and employment opportunities for the local community. </li>
<li><b>Low:</b> Low level of development along coast can have a positive impact on the MMA.</li>
<li><b>Moderate:</b> Moderate development level with best practices creates a positive impact on the MMA.</li>
<li><b>High:</b> Higher level of development activities is a bigger threat to coastal and marine ecosystems.</li>
<li><b>Very High:</b> Very high development levels have an adverse impact on the MMA.</li>
</ul>
