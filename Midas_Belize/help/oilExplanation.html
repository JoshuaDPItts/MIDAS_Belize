<p><b>Instructions: </b>This is an oil spill model based off of the Lehr-Fay equations for oil spreading and moving on the sea.</p>

<ul>

<li><b>Enter the month desired.</b> The average of 5 years of current and surface wind data from 
satellite are used for each month.</li>
<li><b>Enter the type of oil. </b>This accounts for the density of oil. The American Petroleum Index (API)
numbers are shown for reference.</li>
<li><b>Enter the volume of the point spill in barrels. </b>(For reference, the Exxon-Valdez spill in 1989
released approximately 250,000 barrels.</li>
<li><b>Enter the time since spill in minutes. </b>For reasons of accuracy, we have not 
attempted to model beyond 5 hours.</li>
<li><b>To begin, click on the map. </b>You can continue the spill by increasing the time using the time
selection slider.</li>
<li><b>To erase the spill, right click the map.</b></li>
</ul>

<p><b>NOTE: </b>This model is complex and takes a while to run. <b>Please be patient</b></p>
