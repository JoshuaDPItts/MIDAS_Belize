<h2>CDF Comparison Tool</h2>

<p>The CDF comparison tool shows the values for all 18 CDFs as one graph. With this visualization tool, the user is able to perceive trends in his/her inputs and come to general conclusions about the overall state of the social-ecological system. </p> 

<p>The tool is displayed as a bar graph. CDF values (1-5) are shown on the y-axis. Numerical values are used because named levels of individual CDFs may vary, but a value of 1 can generally be thought of as the extreme worst case, a value of 5 as the extreme best case scenario, and a value of 3 as ranked somewhere in the middle (moderate). The graphs background is a vertical color gradient ranging from red (value of 1) to green (value of 5) that displays the range of CDF values. Along to x-axis, each CDF is represented as one white bar. The bar labels refer to letter/number combination assigned to each CDF name in the CDF Input panel. As a CDF slider is moved, the corresponding bar in the graph adjusts to show the CDF value. The x-axis crosses at CDF value 3, so bars displaying good or very good CDF values extend above the axis, bars displaying moderate CDF values also extend above the axis but very small, and bars displaying bad or very bad CDF values extend below the x-axis.</p>

<p>On the right side of the screen, a column of 'Total' boxes displays the total number of CDFs falling into each category. This feature also automatically updates as CDF values are adjusted.</p>
