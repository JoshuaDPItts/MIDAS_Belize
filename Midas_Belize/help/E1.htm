<div class="blue"><h2>E1. Level of Fishing Effort</h2></div>

<p>Fishing effort refers to the economic resources devoted to catching fish. This includes capital goods (e.g., boats and gear), labor (captains and deckhands), and materials and energy. 
A significant issue for fisheries is to ensure the ecological sustainability of wild fish stocks in the long term so that ecosystems that are being fished remain diverse and healthy. Often MMAs are established explicitly because of the high importance that fisheries extraction has in sustaining human societies. Increased fishery yields and improved livelihoods are therefore common and important objectives of MMA use throughout much of the world. This variable is a direct attempt to quantify and track trends in fisheries yields, technological uses, and livelihood opportunities through time. </p>

<p>The maximum biological yield that the fishery is capable of producing is called the Maximum Sustained Yield (MSY). MSY is often regarded as the best target to aim for exploiting resources such as fishery. Fishing at MSY means catching the maximum proportion of fish stock that can safely be removed while, at the same time, maintaining its capacity to produce maximum sustainable returns in the long term. Fishing over MSY levels leads to dangerous depletion of spawning biomass below optimum levels. On the other hand, the Optimum Yield (OY) is the amount of fish harvested that will provide the greatest overall benefit to the nation, with particular reference to food production and recreational opportunities. OY is based on MSY as modified by economic, social or ecological factors. </p>

<div class="blue"><h3>Levels of Fishing Effort:</h3></div>

<ul>

<li><b>Extremely Underfished:</b> The amount of effort used during fishing is very low. </li>
<li><b>Moderately Underfished:</b> Fish stock that has the potential to sustain catches higher than those currently taken.</li>
<li><b>Medium / sustainable:</b> Fishing at Optimum Yields (OY).</li>
<li><b>Moderately Overfished:</b> Fishing at maximum sustainable yield (MSY).</li>
<li><b>Extremely Overfished:</b> Fishing over MSY leads to dangerous depletion of spawning biomass below optimum levels.</li>
