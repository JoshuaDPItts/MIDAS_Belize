<h2>MMA Effectiveness Outcome:</h2>

<p>The MMA effectiveness mixed outcome applet is visualized as two triangles, one for the present day (left) and one representing a five-year future prediction (right). The three sides of each triangle correspond to the three CDF categories, scaled from low to high. The present day triangle compares values for CDFs numbers 1 to 5 in each category, while the future triangle also includes the value for CDF 6. When CDF values are all low, the size of the inner triangle will be small, representing poor overall MMA Effectiveness. When CDF values are all high, the size of the inner triangle is large, representing good to excellent MMA Effectiveness. The colored bar at the bottom of each triangle indicates the overall MMA Effectiveness using the red (bad) to green (excellent) scale used in other indices.</p>
