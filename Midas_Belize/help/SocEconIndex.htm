<div class="pink"><h2>Socioeconomic Index</h2></div>

<p>The Socioeconomic Index is used to evaluate the availability of livelihoods and is visualized as a graph with two columns. The x-axis of the graph shows time, with the column on the left representing present livelihoods and the column on the right representing the expected condition of livelihoods in the near future. The y-axis displays five linguistic scale values for livelihoods, and both columns have corresponding vertical coloration that goes from green (Excellent) to Red (Very Bad). </p>

<p>There are points within each column that represent livelihoods based on user input and expert evaluation (present state) or user prediction and expert best and worst-case prediction (near future state). The expert evalutation and expert best and worst-case predictions are fixed values based on expert opinion, survey data, and literature review. These points are meant to provide a baseline assessment of livelihoods to which users can compare their outcomes. User evaluation and user prediction points are calculated by a simple multi-attribute model that uses a specific set of CDFs and weights. As the user changes the values of these CDFs, the Socioeconomic Index outcome instantly adjusts to reflect the new values. This allows users to conduct thought experiments, evaulating how livelihoods are affected by altering the level of one or more CDFs. </p>
<p>
The following CDFs are used to calculate the user evaulation of present livelihoods:<br>
S1. Perceived threat due to development<br>
S2. Perception of local extractive resources<br>
S3. Non-extractive alternative livelihoods<br>
S4. Socio-Economic benefits from establishment of MMA<br>
S5. Perception of seafood availability<br>
E1. Level of fishing effort<br>
E3. Habitat quality<br>
E5. Focal species abundance<br>
G1. Stakeholder involvement<br>
G5. Empowerment<br>
S6. Expected change in livelihoods over five years, is included in the equations to calculate the user prediction of livelihoods in the near future.</p>
