<div class="pink"><h2>S3. Non-Extractive Alternative Livelihoods</h2></div>

<p>This variable measures the availability of productive activities (occupation, sources of income, both monetary and non-monetary) across households and social groups in the community that do not involve extracting resources from the environment (i.e. seafood, mangrove wood). Some examples of alternative livelihoods include tourist guides, hotel staff, researchers, park management staff, transport industry or food services. Alternative income-generating activities are considered necessary to provide substitute and supplementing income sources for fishing communities in MMAs. This variable will allow for a measure of the dependence of households on coastal extractive resources for livelihood, and changes over time on that dependence. Consequently, this variable will result in a measure of the impact of the MMA on the household occupational structure in the community. </p>
