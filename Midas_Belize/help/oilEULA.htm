<h2>MIDAS Oil Model End User License Agreement:</h2>

<p>The MIDAS team and associated groups including Conservation 
International and Boston University accept no responsibility for policy
directly or indirectly influenced by the MIDAS Oil Model.</p>

<p>The MIDAS team has not had the opportunity to test the model. It is based off
of two primary data sources: 0.5 degree wind and current from NOAA satellites. These data
layers have very coarse resolution and therefore the MIDAS Model assumes no 
predictive power at small scales. Furthermore, the MIDAS Oil Model is based off
of research from Lehr et al. (1994). The MIDAS Oil Model does not assume to be
accurate or based on the latest research.</p>

<p>By accepting this agreement, you relinquish any rights to associate the MIDAS 
group or associated organizations with any of the outcomes of this model.</p>
